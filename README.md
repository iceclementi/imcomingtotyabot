This is a private project to build a Telegram bot which helps to build polls.
What's unique about this bot is that it allows users to **write comments** on their chosen option!

While this may be a private project, it is **open-source**. 
Feel free to use my code, make changes, and run on your own server üòâ.

## Bot Usage

### Commands

Bot commands always begin with a `/` character.
Essentially it starts a conversation with the bot and triggers it to carry out a
particular action.

### Inline Queries
Inline queries to the bot begin with the bot's username, i.e. `@imcomingtotyabot`. The 
best thing about inline queries is its auto-complete functionality üòÅ.
