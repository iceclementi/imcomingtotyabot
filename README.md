This is a private project to build a Telegram bot which helps to build polls.
What's unique about this bot is that it allows users to **write comments** on their chosen option!

While this may be a private project, it is **open-source**. 
Feel free to use my code, make changes, and run on your own server üòâ.

## Bot Usage

### Commands
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>‚Ñπ</h3></td>
    <td>
      As different users have different access privileges, the default Telegram command
      suggestions cannot be used üò≠.
      <br><br>
      As a compromise, <a href="#inline-queries">inline queries</a> are used to 
      display the available commands to you. 
      <br><br>
      Alternatively, you may use the <code>/help</code> command for the bot to display 
      the list of commands available to you and their functions.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Bot commands always begin with a `/` character.
Essentially it starts a conversation with the bot and triggers it to carry out a
particular action.
  
Below is a list of bot commands as of this version.

| Command         | Description                                             | Permission Type |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:---------------:|
| `/start`        | Views the bot's welcome message                         |      None       |
| `/poll [title]` | Builds a new poll with an optional title                |       Bot       |

| `/help`         | Views the help message to show available commands       |      None       |

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>‚Ñπ</h3></td>
    <td>
      If you try to use a bot command that is invalid or that you do not have access to, 
      the bot will very intelligently show you the help message instead üòÜ.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Inline Queries
Inline queries to the bot begin with the bot's username, i.e. `@imcomingtotyabot`. The 
best thing about inline queries is its auto-complete functionality üòÅ.
  
Below is a list of inline queries processed by the bot as of this version.

| Inline Query       | Description                                                                               | Permission Type |
